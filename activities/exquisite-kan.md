# Exquisite Kan

## Overview
Inspired by the Surrealist drawing exercise known as 'Exquisite Corpse', Exquisite Kan is a collaborative painting project. As part of the project 3x Killa Kan models (produced by Games Workshop) will be _partially_ built and distributed amongst the participants. Each participant will paint (and optionally modify) the pieces before returning them.

This is done in isolation, meaning that none of the participants are aware of the other participants' modifications or colour palette choices. Although each participant will receive multiple pieces, there is not guarantee that these pieces will be applied to the same model.

## Rationale
This is an opportunity for collections of hobbyists to remotely collaborate, and to exercise their modeling and painting skills.

## Roles

### Facilitator
The facilitator is responsible for acquiring the models, assembling the parts (eg. halves of legs into single legs, halves of torsos into single torsos, etc.), and distributing them amongst the participants. Additionally, the facilitator will receive the painted/modified pieces, assemble the finished models, and apply any touch-ups that may be required.

### Participants
The participants will receive, optionally modify, and paint the pieces. Each participant is responsible for returning the pieces to the facilitator.

## Pieces
- Torso (3x)
- Left arm (3x)
- Right arm (3x)
- Legs and base (3x)

## Risks and Challenges
- Assembling the painted (and optionally modified) pieces may be difficult.
- Distributing and returning the pieces may be difficult.

## Timeline
- Week 1: Buy, assemble, and prime the pieces.
- Week 2: Ship the pieces to the participants.
- Week 3 - 4: Modify and paint the pieces.
- Week 5: Return the pieces to the facilitator.
- Week 6: Assemble the finished models.
- Week 7: Photograph the models and share the results.
