# Subfactions - Death Guard

## Subfactions

### Apostles of Contagion

"Nurgle's Breath"

At the end of the movement phase, roll a D6 for each enemy model within 1" of a Death Guard model you control. On a roll of 6+, the enemey model takes a mortal wound.

### Carrion Hounds

"Nurgle's Embrace"

Each time an enemy model is taken out of action by a model you control, roll a D6. On a roll of 6+, place a Poxwalker model within 1" of the enemy model's former position. This model is under your control, but is not taken into account when determining whether or not a 'break' test must be made.

### Glooming Lords

"Nurgle's Protection"

Enemy models who target Death Guard models under your control must subtract 1 from their hit rolls. For the purposes of rule resolution, this does not count as being in cover.

## Potential Subfactions
- Corpsemakers: Rule focusing on negative modifiers when in cover.
- Lords of Silence: Rule focusing on 'raider' lore. Possibly an addtional 'decisive move'.

- Pox Mortis: Rule focusin on blight grenade lore.
- Tainted Sons: Rule focusing on 'fixation' lore. Possibly hit and wound modifiers when targeting the same model.
- Weeping Legion: Rule focusing on 'resiliance' lore. Possibly an armour save modifier.
