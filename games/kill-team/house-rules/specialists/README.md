# Specialists

## Strategy Specialists
Any warrior that has engaged in a skirmish and lived to tell the tale is a combination of skilled, clever, and lucky. However, strategy specialists have not only survived dozens of combat encounters, they have analyzed and learned from them as well.

### Tactics

#### New Intelligence (1 CP)
Use this tactic once per game. At the end of the movement phase, select a Strategy specialist that is both under your control and that has not moved this round. This specialist may make a normal move, advance, or charge.

### Skill Tree

#### Level 1

##### Tactical Reaction
If this specialist begins the battle round in combat but is no longer in combat at the beginning of your movement phase, the specialist may ready, move, advance, or charge as normal.

## Defense Specialists
Defense specialists are masters of armour, cover, and mitigating the dangers of combat. Their staying power is second to none and their ability to deploy ad hoc cover is often the difference between life and death for their squad mates.

### Tactics

### Ad Hoc Cover (1 CP)
Use this tactic when the Defense specialist is selected in the movement phase. Instead of moving the Defense specialist deploys their ad hoc terrain. In the following shooting phase, all hit roles which target the Defense specialist or friendly models that are obstructed by the Defense specialist receive a -1. For the purposes for injury resolution the Defense specialist counts as being in cover.

### Skill Tree

#### Level 1

##### Is That All?
Injury rolls that target this specialist receive a -1 to a minimum of 1.
